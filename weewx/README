This directory contains a 'Skin' for weewx which outputs weather metrics into a
Prometheus metric file that can be scraped by Prometheus.

To use
1) Copy the 'Prom' directory into your Skins folder (e.g. /etc/weewx/skins/)
2) In your weewx.conf, add the following stanza within the [StdReport] section
     
    [[Prom]]
        skin = Prom
3) Restart weewx, your metrics file should show up in your standard HTML output directory
4) In your prometheus config add a scrape_configs stanza as follows:

  - job_name: 'weather'
    metrics_path: '/weewx/metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-weewx-webserver.localdomain']
